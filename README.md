In order to prepare for a massive exit of net giants, let's collect some free applications missing to replace the services.

Look, Google tends to shut down services no matter how popular they were. Same holds true for Adobe.

So I'm thinking about how companies and organisations can become independent of those giants. Sadly, most services aren't replaceable, yet. If you know an Open Source (or even better: Free Software) solution, let me know! Either per PR or Issue or Mail or however you like.

To prevent censorship, P2P applications may be preferred.
